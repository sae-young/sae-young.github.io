I am a Ph.D. student in the technology management-economics-policy program at Seoul National University. \
My current research interests lie in the methodology of graph learning and its application in scientometrics. Specifically, my research focuses on quantifying the technological capabilities of nations through two main approaches. Firstly, I employ economic complexity measures to assess relative technological competitiveness in different countries. Secondly, I investigate citation networks of academic publications and patents to gain insights on dynamics of research careers. By combining these approaches, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the scientific and technological landscape, facilitating informed policy decisions and driving innovation.

I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering (thermodynamics on fuel cell & electrolysis system) from Yonsei University.
